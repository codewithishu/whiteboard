# whiteboard
This is a project made using React js and so many libraries and packages .It is basically required to ease the way of teaching as it provides whiteboard where we can draw, images, write using mouse .it provides the connection between client and server using socket.io. 
1. Setup React.js Project:
    Install Node.js if not already installed.
    Create a new React app using Create React App or any other preferred method.
   
2. Design Whiteboard Interface:
    Create components for drawing area, tools (like pen, eraser, color picker), and any additional UI elements.
   Use HTML5 Canvas for drawing functionalities.
   
3. Implement Drawing Functionalities:
     Write functions to handle drawing on the canvas.
     Implement event handlers for mouse movements and clicks to draw lines.
   
5. Integrate Socket.io:
     Install Socket.io client library in the React app.
   Initialize Socket.io connection with the server.
   
6. Real-time Collaboration:
    Emit drawing events to the server whenever a user draws something on the canvas.
    Listen for drawing events from other users and update the canvas accordingly.
* Backend (Node.js)
  
1.  Setup Node.js Project:
      Initialize a new Node.js project using npm or yarn.
      Install necessary dependencies including Express.js and Socket.io.
    
3.  Create Server with Express.js:
     Set up an Express.js server to serve static files from the React.js build directory.
     Handle Socket.io connections.
    
5.  Implement Socket.io Server:
     Initialize Socket.io server and listen for connections.
     Implement event handlers for receiving and broadcasting drawing events.
    
7.   Handle Concurrent Drawing Sessions:
       Manage multiple drawing sessions for different whiteboards or rooms.
       Associate socket connections with specific whiteboard sessions.
     
* Integration (React.js + Node.js)
  
1.  Connect Frontend with Backend:
      Configure the React app to connect to the Socket.io server hosted by the Node.js backend.
      Use Socket.io client to establish and manage the connection.
    
2.  Real-time Communication:
     Emit drawing events from the frontend to the backend whenever a user interacts with the whiteboard.
     Broadcast drawing events received from one client to all other clients connected to the same whiteboard session.
    
3.  Handle Error and Disconnect:
     Implement error handling and disconnection logic on both client and server sides.
     Manage reconnecting sockets if connections drop unexpectedly.
    
4. Deploy:
     Deploy the Node.js backend to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS.
     Build the React.js frontend and deploy it to a static hosting service or integrate it with the Node.js server for a unified deployment.
   
5.  Testing and Refinement:
      Test the application thoroughly, especially its real-time collaboration features.
      Refine and optimize the codebase for performance and scalability.
